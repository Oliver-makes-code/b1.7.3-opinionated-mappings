# b1.7.3-official-mappings
Enigma mappings for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 based on all official sources.

This project makes use of the following sources, in order of priority:
 - Minecraft Pocket Edition symbol tables, with earlier versions considered a better source.
 - De-obfuscation maps for Minecraft 1.14.4. These are particularly useful for determining packages.
 - My own opinions.
 - Searge MCP mappings for Beta 1.7.3.
